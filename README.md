Hi! My name is Tony. I'm a computer science student at the University of Washington. I previously did game development in Unreal Engine 5 and Unity. 

I'm now interested in large scale distributed systems. My most recent project is a miniature distributed storage system using a Raspberry Pi 4 and 16x Raspberry Pi Picos.
