Hi! My name is Tony. I'm a computer science student at the University of Washington. I have an interest in game development and most of my time is spent playing video games or working on video games. 

I enjoy using Unreal Engine 5. Some of the game genres I have worked on are shooters and survival games (even a little bit of 2D as well). My main interests are making multiplayer games as I think games with friends are always more fun. Plus learning networking and replication between server and client is always cool. 

I'm currently learning how to make a survival game.
